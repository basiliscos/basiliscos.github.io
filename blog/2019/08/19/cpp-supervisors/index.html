    <h1>The notion of supervisor &amp; trees of supervisors</h1>

<p>Erlang is famous for its <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html">erlang-supervisor</a> approach, i.e. an actor which is
responsible managing it&#39;s child actors lifetime (start, restart, shutdown).</p>

<p>In regular C++ code an error (exception) propagates towards the caller-side.
In actor-based approach error is supervised by an actor owner (supervisor) and
it&#39;s up to supervisor to decide how to react, e.g. restart actor but if it
crashed no more than 3 times per minute. The caller-side is decoupled from
this details at all.</p>

<p>In the case of child crash supervisor might decide either to restart it,
or, if the local situation is considered too bad, then shutdown itself (and all it&#39;s
children) and <em>delegate</em> the problem upwards, i.e. to is&#39;t own supervisor.
The parent supervisor might, again, decide either restart or delegate the
problem upwards again.</p>

<p>That form of delegating problem upto root supervisor naturally form tree
of responsibilities, or, if you like, tree of supervision. This allows
to an application slowly degrade and still be available (provide service)
when non-fatal errors occur.</p>

<h1>C++ supervising specifics</h1>

<p>Erlang supervisors tolerate even programmer errors; this is known as <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?LetItCrash">let-it-crash</a>
principle, as a supervisor will just respawn crashed actor.</p>

<p>In C++ we cannot tolerate developer mistakes as in Erlang: there is no
reasonable reaction in general to leaked memory or <code>std::abort()</code> call, right?
Instead, in C++ world we assume that an actor is able to detect that it
is in invalid state, and just terminate, possibly notifying it&#39;s exit
reason upwards. In the upper layer the actor exit will be observed,
and a decision will be made how to handle with the situation.</p>

<h1>Supervisor-like capabilities of caf &amp; sobjectizer</h1>

<h2>caf (c++ actor framework)</h2>

<p>There is no explicit supervisor role in <a href="https://actor-framework.org/">caf</a>. However, according to
documentation <a href="https://actor-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MessagePassing.html#down-handler">caf-monitor</a>, it is possible to subscribe to special system
<em>down message</em> and provide appropriate reaction. This can be done in recursive
manner, i.e. tree of responsibilities <em>can</em> be build.</p>

<p>However, if I read documentation correctly, any actor can monitor
any other actor death. The responsibility of reaction is somewhat blurred
from the API perspective. Let&#39;s name the approach <em>supervising-via-monitoring</em>.</p>

<p>As the actors are spawned (and owned) by <code>system</code>, the application at the
runtime does not creates an hierarchy, i.e. it is flat:</p>

<p><img alt="caf.png" src="caf.png"></p>

<p>There is actors groupping capabilities in <a href="https://actor-framework.org/">caf</a>, which allows to multicast
messages to all actors inside the group, e.g. shutdown messsage.</p>

<h2>sobjectizer</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a> actors (agents, in the sobjectizer&#39;s terminology) are spawned
by <code>cooperation</code>; the cooperation itself is created by <code>environment</code> (the
similar role to <code>system</code> in <a href="https://actor-framework.org/">caf</a>). <code>cooperations</code> can create child <code>cooperations</code>,
thus making a hierarchy.</p>

<p>However, it should be noted, that <code>cooperation</code> in <a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a> <em>in not an actor</em>;
it is the type provided by <a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a> and there is no possibility to roll
your own implementation.</p>

<p>The <code>cooperation</code> in <a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a> is some kind of supervisable group of actors,
as it requires that all actors to be started and successfully registered; if
any of them fails, coorepation will shutdown and unregister all (already registered)
actors.</p>

<p>Actors <em>are managed</em> by <code>cooperations</code>; how actors can get back the information
from <code>cooperations</code>? The <code>notificator</code> object should be created by <code>cooperation</code>
with the messages destination <code>mbox</code>; then the notificator object should be added
into the cooperation. Notificators are two kinds: <code>reg</code> and <code>dereg</code>, i.e. they
observe actors startup or shutdown events. Lastly, actor should subscribe
to the appropriate event on the message box. However,this is not an individual
actor shutdown event, it is <em>whole cooperation</em> shutdown event (<code>registration</code>
or <code>deregistration</code>).</p>

<p>Now follows my own vision how to get <em>fine-gained</em> supervising.</p>

<p>Thus, there is no <em>direct</em> actor shutdown observation; only indirect (i.e.
via cooperation death notification). If there is need to observe individual
actor shutdown, it should be the only actor on a <code>cooperation</code>, and the
cooperation should be monitored; in the case of actor crash, it the new
cooperation should be spawned, and the new actor should be spawned on it,
and the monitoring subscription routine above should be repeated.</p>

<p>This can be visualized as the following:</p>

<p><img alt="sobjectizer.png" src="sobjectizer.png"></p>

<p>However, this looks a little bit overcomplicated. Indeed, <a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a>
way of supervising is <em>coarse-grained</em> supervising: not individual actors
should be supervised, but group of related actors (<code>cooperation</code>).</p>

<h1>Supervising in Rotor</h1>

<p>In <a href="https://github.com/basiliscos/cpp-rotor/">rotor</a> we&#39;d like to achieve <em>fine-gained</em> Erlang-like supervising:</p>

<p><img alt="rotor.png" src="rotor.png"></p>

<p>Please note the absence of dotted lines, as they coincide with the solid
lines, because the <em>ownership</em> of an actor is the same of <em>supervising</em> it.
An supervisor in <a href="https://github.com/basiliscos/cpp-rotor/">rotor</a> is also an actor. The supervising hierarchy is
naturally formed (unlike in <a href="https://actor-framework.org/">caf</a>), and still there are no doubling
of the hierarchy as in <a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a>, where framework supplied managing
units (<code>cooperations</code>) are intermixed with user supplied actors.</p>

<p>However, parent-child relation between supervisors upto <code>v0.02</code> version
was available only for <a href="https://www.boost.org:/doc/libs/release/libs/asio/" title="Boost Asio">boost-asio</a> based supervisors... because each
supervisor incorporated own <code>strand</code>, which was generated by root
<code>io_context</code>. That way it was a mixture of execution controller
and supervising; so the real picture was like:</p>

<p><img alt="rotor-v0.02.png" src="rotor-v0.02.png"></p>

<p>Nonetheless, it imposed the sequential execution context (<code>strand</code>) for every
supervisor, while it not necessary was needed. Also, the supervising hierarchy
was not available for other event-loops, because <code>strand</code> seems the <a href="https://www.boost.org:/doc/libs/release/libs/asio/" title="Boost Asio">boost-asio</a>
unique feature.</p>

<p>To solve the situation, the <code>locality</code> notion was introduced. Under the hood,
it is plain <code>const void*</code> marker. By default, locality just a pointer to
root supervisor, if two supervisors has the same locality, they are executed
in the same (thread-safe) context. This makes it possible to have supervising
trees in all supported event loops in rotor.</p>

<p>How about <a href="https://www.boost.org:/doc/libs/release/libs/asio/" title="Boost Asio">boost-asio</a>? <code>locality</code> here become a pointer to <code>strand</code>, making
it possible to introduce executing context (implies supervising) on demand,
i.e. something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="rotor-v0.03.png" src="rotor-v0.03.png"></p>

<p>Here <code>supervisor_root</code>, <code>supervisor_1</code>, <code>supervisor_2</code> are executed on
the context on one <code>strand</code>, while <code>supervisor_2</code> has it&#39;s own <code>strand</code>.</p>

<p>This is available in <a href="https://github.com/basiliscos/cpp-rotor/">rotor</a> <code>v0.03</code>. (This led to API breaking changes,
as now boost::asio supervisor takes <code>strand</code> shared pointer in config).</p>

<h2>Rotor v0.03 messaging internals</h2>

<p>Messaging in rotor done without private actor&#39;s message boxes unlike
<a href="https://github.com/Stiffstream/sobjectizer">sobjectizer</a> and <a href="https://actor-framework.org/">caf</a>. Every <code>address</code> (message delivery endpoint) is generated
by a <code>supervisor</code> a reference to the supervisor is embedded into the <code>address</code>.
So, during messages processing phase by each supervisor, it compared the reference
in message destination <code>address</code> with the self (<code>this</code>), and if the match occurs
the message was routed locally; otherwise the message was delivered for other
<code>supervisor</code> for further (local) routing.</p>

<p>Since <a href="https://github.com/basiliscos/cpp-rotor/">rotor</a> <code>v0.03</code> <code>address</code> object also embeds <code>locality</code> (<code>const void*</code>). If
it matches to the <code>locality</code> of the supervisor, then the destination supervisor is
taken from the <code>address</code> and the message is <em>immediately locally routed</em> in the
context of the destination supervisor.</p>

<p>To make it possible, all supervisors with the same locality have to share the
same queue of messages. The obvious way to achieve that is that child-supervisors
with the same locality use root supervisor&#39;s messages queue.</p>

<p>In other words, a message is sent to locality, where all it&#39;s supervisors are
<em>peers entry points</em>.</p>
