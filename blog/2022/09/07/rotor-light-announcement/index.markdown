I was asked by a few friends of mine to develop something like 
[rotor](https://github.com/basiliscos/cpp-rotor/) but to be
usable on embedded, with the restrictions for embedded
platform like no dynamic allocations, no RTTI etc. Please,
meet the [rotor-light](https://notabug.org/basiliscos/cpp-rotor-light),
which is capable to run even on 8-bit AVR microcontroller
(Arduino Uno R3)!
